//! The operators of SLEIGH's p-code expression language.
//!
//! SLEIGH's operands carry a size but no type, so an operator has to say how
//! its bits are to be read. Where a machine operation differs between signed,
//! unsigned and floating-point interpretations, SLEIGH spells the three
//! differently — `/`, `s/` and `f/` — and each spelling is a separate variant
//! here. A consumer lowering to its own IR reads the variant, not the operand.
